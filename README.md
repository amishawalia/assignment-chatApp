## How It Works

  A database called "chat_db" named is created via code. 
  The nickname, msg, group information is also kept in the table named Messages.
    
  User to user, As a publication broadcast or group in the room  messaging.
  User to user messaging:
   <pre> /w username messagetext</pre> the message is sent as.
      
 ## Sockets
    
   Having an active connection opened between the client and the server so client can send and receive data. This allows             real-time communication using TCP sockets. This is made possible by Socket.io.

   The client starts by connecting to the server through a socket(maybe also assigned to a specific namespace). Once connections is successful, client and server can emit and listen to events. 

## RESTful

  Using HTTP requests, we can use the respective action to trigger every of these four CRUD operations.    
    <li>POST is used to send data to a server — Create</li>
    <li>GET is used to fetch data from a server — Read</li>
    <li>PUT is used to send and update data — Update</li>
    <li>DELETE is used to delete data — Delete  </li>
